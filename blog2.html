    <h1>How do we draw a line between "content" and harmful media(e.g. hate speech, misinformation, explicit content, etc.)?</h1>

    <p class="parag4">In this digital era, we are experiencing constant exposure on social media. We can now easily use open platforms where we can post or share our opinions, thoughts, ideas, and even our personal experiences with others. Unfortunately, this may lead to harmful media such as hate speech, misinformation, explicit content, and more. Therefore, it is important to know: how do we draw a line between "content" and harmful media?</p>
    <p class="parag4">We can observe that in this generation, there are some circumstances where harmful media is apparently becoming the content and source of entertainment for others, which is alarming because not all the time we can control the harm caused by the media, and it may influence the individual to spread misinformation or any negative impacts from their exposure to it. In this regard, we can draw a line or a border between "content" and harmful media by following community guidelines and policies given on social media platforms. An example of this is when we're using Facebook. As we noticed, Facebook has community standards or policies that should be followed by users or content creators; otherwise, they might be restricted for a few days or their post might be deleted if they violate any Facebook community policies or if the content is detected as misinformation. Users can also report inappropriate content or posts to avoid harmful effects on an individual. Aside from what I mentioned, being media literate can also help us distinguish between "content" and harmful media. Media literacy is the ability to understand the complex messages from media; it is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media. If we have this ability, we can easily understand certain topics or issues and create a border between content and harmful media for the sake of ourselves and others.</p>
    <p class="parag4">Eventually, making a border between content and harmful media is difficult, but it plays an important role in balancing the freedom to express and protection of individuals from harm that we need to consider in making limitations.</p>
