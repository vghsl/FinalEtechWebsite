    <h1>Do you think we are desensitized by the amount of information that we consume? Why or why not?</h1>

<p class="parag4">As time passes, the amount of information on social media is increasing. Too much exposure to the media and other platforms with overwhelming different forms of information may contribute to desensitization. Desensitization is a psychological process by which a response is repeatedly elicited in situations where the action tendency that arises out of the emotion proves to be irrelevant.</p>
<p class="parag4">In this generation, all kinds of information sources are readily available. Therefore, we can access any kind of information that we need. It's also true that it is more convenient for us to use social media as a source of information. However, too much exposure on social media can also have a negative impact on users; one of these is desensitization. In reality, because of open sources, we can now unintentionally consume information by simply scrolling, such as on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media apps that people use to get and share information. This may cause a sense of overwhelm and difficulty comprehending all the information that we hear or see and lead to desensitization.</p>
<p class="parag4">As a final observation, desensitization is understandable because it's normal that we consume a bunch of information time after time every day, but it is important to limit our exposure to the media. Likewise, it is also important that we fully understand the content of certain information in order to be aware of the information that we consume and apply to ourselves. </p>
