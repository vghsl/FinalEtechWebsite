    <h1>In situations where there is no clear netiquette guideline, what should be the basis for making a decision about how to behave online?</h1>

    <p class="parag4">Since social media is free and accessible to anyone, it is possible that you may encounter inappropriate and disrespectful contexts. These misunderstandings can have a negative impact on you and on the other people who saw the certain harmful context. As we spend more time on social media, it is important that we understand the simple things we need to consider when we have to make a decision, and there are no clear netiquette guidelines for socializing and using various types of social media platforms. Today we will identify the three most important principles that we can use if there are no clear netiquette guidelines.</p>
    <p class="parag4">Consider the perspective of others. We all have different opinions and perspectives. Therefore, thinking before posting anything will help us avoid misunderstandings. We should be mindful of the contents of our post. The use of words will also cause misinterpretation, so it is important that we are aware of what words we're using. Anticipating the potential consequences and how certain things will affect others can also help us be wiser in our use of social media. In addition, know your limits. We should not cross the boundary because there are limits to everything. It is also important, especially when it comes to privacy. Most importantly, we should consider RESPECT. We should keep in mind that respect always matters. Respect others the way you want to be respected. In this generation, we're too exposed to different types of harmful posts, contexts, and even toxic people on the internet, but that doesn't mean that we let ourselves give the same energy that the internet does. It is important to understand that we don't have the same situation as others, and we don't have the same opinions as them. All we have to do is understand and respect them, as long as they respect you and they know their limits.</p>
    <p class="parag4">Eventually, there are a lot of things that we have to consider in deciding how to behave online, but considering others' perspectives, limitations, and respect will probably help us make wise decisions in using and socializing online.</p>
